> (20pin SOP) - seems to have an SPI bus, and seems to talk to the mosfets that
> control the ignition. I mailed ST micro, but they immediadly accused me of
> reverse engineering and told me i wont get any details (bad luck i guess),
> i found a brazilian website that sell those (ECU repair shop) but they also
> told me they dont have any specs, and said its very hard to get those.
> Forget google and co, nothing comes up except chinese resellers.
> Thats why im trying my luck here - so if anyone has any insight what this
