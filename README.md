This is my attempt to tune my Lotus Exige S2.

It's heaveliy based on the work of [Obeisance] and [Cybernet].

I didn't have a Arduino with a CAN-Shield but I have an USB-to-CAN Adapter.
So I made my own Python-Script (Linux Only) to make the dump. It sould also work
with a RaspberryPi and a CAN-Shield (SocketCAN Driver).

After that I've realized that the Calibration ROM located at 0x10000 looks like
identical to the T4 ECU at address 0x70000. So I've edited the XML to use the
new offset.

That's it for now.
